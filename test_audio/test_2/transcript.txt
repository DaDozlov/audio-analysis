Today’s meeting covered several key points. I will finalize the Q3 marketing campaign plan by drafting the new ad copy, which is due next Tuesday, 09.06.2025. I decided to increase our social media budget by 20% and add an extra $5,000 for LinkedIn ads. I need to update the brand guidelines before launching the creative, so I’ll review and revise them by Friday. I also flagged potential compliance issues to ensure we meet all regulatory requirements. A risk I foresee is a delay in the legal team’s review process, so I’ll follow up with Legal by 10.06.2025. For our next session, I will prepare the updated guidelines, complete the ad copy draft, and confirm the budget transfers.
